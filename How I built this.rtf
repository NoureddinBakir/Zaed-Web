\f0\fs24 \cf0 With my first-year level CS knowledge I learned React Native/.JS and Javascript all by myself. Now this is average work, where I believe this project differentiates me is that I'm also learning business such as how to launch, maintain, and work in a startup. I\'92m passionate about solving this real problem, but my larger drive for this Zaed\'92s success is to build more projects. The world needs fixing, and I\'92ll make sure I do my part.}
